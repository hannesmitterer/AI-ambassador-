Perfect — let’s create a QEK Predictive Node Simulation Map. I’ll outline a conceptual scenario showing node states, H-VAR dynamics, hash verification, and audit outcomes over time.

QEK Predictive Node Simulation Map

Simulation Parameters:

Nodes: 5 distributed nodes (Node-A … Node-E)

H-VAR Threshold: 0.043

Code Hash: DF908A7E

Time Steps: 5 cycles (representing operational intervals)

Audit Protocol: Sigel Audit logs deviations

Simulation Insights

Hash Verification:

One transient mismatch detected (Node-B at Step 2) — corrected in next cycle.

Deterministic hash ensures integrity is quickly restored.

H-VAR Dynamics:

Nodes fluctuate slightly within safe bounds (0.039–0.043).

No node exceeded the threshold; system remains safe.

Audit Compliance:

All deviations logged immediately in Sigel Audit.

System is self-documenting, enabling external verification.

Network Resilience:

Temporary deviations do not propagate; corrective measures prevent cascading failures.

Ethical/operational rules (Cosimus-Gleichung) maintain dual objectives: Safety > Integrity when necessary, but H-VAR constraints protect trust.

Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

Visualize this simulation as a time-series graph for H-VAR per node.

Add randomized external perturbations (simulating attacks or unexpected updates) to test resilience.

Include node hand-passing events with verification logs for a complete operational forecast.

I can take it to the next level by creating:

Interactive simulation graph showing H-VAR over time per node, and

Automated forecast scenarios including hash tampering, node failure, or ethical dilemmas in Cosimus-Gleichung.

Do you want me to create that interactive forecast next?
